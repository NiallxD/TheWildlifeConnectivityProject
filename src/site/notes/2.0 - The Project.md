# Project Phases – Wildlife Connectivity

Our project has been designed to incorporate fine-tuning our plan as we proceed through each phase. Beyond our initial Scoping Phase, activities completed or anticipated are:

        <h2 style="margin: 0;">Stage 1</h2>
	    <h3 style="margin: 0;">(April 2023 – March 2024): Connectivity Modelling</h3>
        <p>This initial stage of work involved establishment of the overall governance framework and the refinement of project approach and methods of assessment. It included a longitudinal assessment of environmental change using a framework of indicators developed in partnership with [TerrAdapt.org](http://terradapt.org/). Indicators monitor historical trends in habitat loss, ecosystem integrity, wildlife connectivity and natural capital over the last ~40 years (1985-2023). Model outputs are used to identify hotspot areas of biodiversity loss, habitat core areas and regional pathways of wildlife movement for umbrella species (Grizzly, Wolverine, Fisher & Lynx). Environmental variables are combined with wildlife occurrence data for more localized indicator species to assess patterns of habitat use and pathways of movement at scales that will be relevant to land management decisions at the site level. </p>

        <h2 style="margin: 0;">Stage 2</h2>
	    <h3 style="margin: 0;">(April 2024 – March 2025): Wildlife Corridor Design</h3>
        <p>This stage of the assessment process involves a more in-depth analysis of environmental values within wildlife habitat areas and connectivity pathways that are relevant to conservation planning activities led by project partners.  Outputs will be used to co-design an integrated network of wildlife corridors and to identify specific land management actions that are effective in protecting, restoring, and maintaining critical habitat and pathways of movement for the broadest possible range of native species. The delineation of wildlife corridor networks will build on the strengths of both Indigenous and Western knowledge systems and input from both community members and affected parties.</p>

        <h2 style="margin: 0;">Stage 3</h2>
	    <h3 style="margin: 0;">(April 2025 – onward): Wildlife Connectivity Action Plan</h3>
        <p>Final stages of the project are focused on planning scenarios that help make evident the strengths and weaknesses of proposed land management strategies in achieving biodiversity goals and targets identified by project partners. The intended outcome is co-development of a Wildlife Connectivity Action Plan and associated biodiversity conservation strategies that can be incorporated into ongoing planning processes by project partners and updated on an ongoing basis as conditions change or as new information becomes available. 
        <p>
		Land management actions may include measures to restore and protect linear landscape corridors (e.g., riparian and wetland habitat) and “stepping-stone” patches that facilitate the movement of wildlife species between more intact core areas of natural terrestrial habitat; and measures that allow animals to move safely across roads and/or other human-made barriers through a variety of mitigation structures (e.g., culverts, underpasses, overpasses, directional fences).</p>
