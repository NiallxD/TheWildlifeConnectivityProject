# Photo Wall

This is my photo wall. It was inspired by the profile view from Instagram, but here it's advert free, and no distracting likes or comments. It's just a feed of my photos over time. I've provided a heart emoji in case you feel the need to tap it!

> 🏞️ **Common Crossbill**
> 📆 **02/06/2024**
> 📝 LIFER! Today, by chance, I photographed a common crossbill. Interestingly, the Scottish and Common Crossbills look identical. According to Merlin, the only way to tell them apart is with lab studies such as computer analysis of their calls or DNA. Given the location I saw them, on Skye, they will be the Common Crossbill. Super cool to see and photograph!

> 🏞️ **Cuckoo Lifer**
> 📆 **27/05/2022**
> 📝 I've been trying to photograph the common cuckoo for far too long. Admittedly, I've probably not put in enough effort in the past, however this year I was determined to do so. As I plan to travel to Canada early next year, I'm on a mission to photograph species that I won't see there. So the Common Cuckoo was on the list. After a dreadful storm, the skies cleared and I decided to give a local spot where I'd heard a cuckoo calling recently. To my amazement, upon turning a corner, there was a cuckoo, perched on a tree...It's moments like this which make all the effort worth it.

> 🏞️ **Eyes Bigger Than Your Belly!**
> 📆 **25/05/2022**
> 📝 While walking along a path at RSPB Old Moor with Claudia, she suddenly shouted "What's that?!"... We soon realised it was a stoat with a coot chick in it's mouth. Stoat are well known for catching prey larger than themselves so it's no surprise it has snatched this easy meal.

> 🏞️ **Herons Tongue**
> 📆 **16/05/2022**
> 📝 Sometimes wildlife photography isn't about telling powerful and impactful stories of nature and our wild landscapes; it's about telling the silly stories of nature too. Just like how we take photos of our pets doing silly things, wildlife is no different. Here a heron sticks it's tongue out at me, as if to say, bet you've not see a heron do this before?! 😝

> 🏞️ **Golden Wings**
> 📆 **15/05/2022**
> 📝 Early morning or just before sunset are well known to be the best times of the day for photography, especially if you're looking for the superb colours of the golden sun. I tend to hang around till right before sunset if I can to snap some shots. Many prefer to be infront of the subject (with the sun behind you), but I can't help but be drawn to the rich golden colours you can get from shooting into the sun!🌞

> 🏞️ **Humble Grey Wagtail**
> 📆 **13/05/2022**
> 📝 It's lovely when you're sat waiting for something in nature, such as a kingfisher, and then something catches you off guard. This grey wagtail popped down onto a rock infront of me. I kneeled down and was able to fire off some really nice shots, with my camera just barely off the water's surface. Aren't these birds just beautiful?!

> 🏞️ **Common Blue Damselfly
> 📆 **11/05/2022**
> 📝 After what seems to have been the longest winter of my life, I was a teeny bit giddy to see my first damselfly of the season. I was at Potteric Carr when this beauty drifted past the front of the hide. It quickly swapped to my macro (I was anticipating this day!) and snapped some shots. I'm forever amazed by the intracy of these creatures. Blows my mind!🤯

> 🏞️ Aurora Borealis
> 📆 **11/05/2022**
> 📝 Most of the World was aware of this event. A huge blast of solar wind created some incredible displays of the Aurora (both north and south). What is perhaps most amazing about this is that millions of people took an interest in the natural processes of our planet. For just a few hours, people from all walks of life witnessed our planet protecting us from harmful particles. If only we could all take an hour out of our day to do something to help protect it back🌍🌱

> 🏞️ **Bugs for tea**
> 📆 **10/05/2022**
> 📝 One of the adult dippers approaching the nest with a bill full of bugs. When you sit and watch birds during spring time, it's remarkable how much food they can gather to feed their hungry chicks. It's also really nice watching them work together as often you only see birds doing their own thing.
